### Hi there 👋  

I am a full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience.  

I have worked with and on a microservices-based **e-commerce** platform developed and maintained by [Juice](https://www.juice.com.hr/),  
integrating various **payment** services, implementing **SEO** requirements for **multi-market webshops**, ERP integration, **CRM** and **CMS**.  

My technical skills include working with **Angular** framework, **Node.js**, Bootstrap, **MongoDB**, SAP...

My programming languages are **TypeScript** and **Golang**, plus rusty Java and R.     

I have experience in DevOps processes (Jenkins, AWS, GitHub actions) and Agile development (Jira).

I have average communication and presentation skills, a good attitude toward **teamwork**, and experience **onboarding** Junior developers. 

I am also interested in **UX** design, **DX** and femtech.
