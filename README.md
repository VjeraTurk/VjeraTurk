### Hi there 👋  

I am a full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience.  
I have worked with and on a microservices-based **e-commerce** platform developed and maintained by [Juice](https://www.juice.com.hr/),  
integrating various **payment** services and implementing **SEO** requirements for **multi-market webshops**.  

My technical skills include working with Angular framework, Node.js, Bootstrap, MongoDB, SAP...
    
I have experience in DevOps processes (Jenkins, AWS) and Agile development (Jira).
 
My programming languages are **TypeScript** and **go**, plus rusty Java and R.     
  
I have average communication and presentation skills, a good attitude towards **teamwork**, and experience **onbording** Junior developers.   
I also have an interest in **UX** design, **DX** and femtech.
