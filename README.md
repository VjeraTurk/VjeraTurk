### Hi there 👋  

I am a full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience.  
I have worked with and on a microservices-based **e-commerce** platform developed and maintained by [Juice](https://www.juice.com.hr/),  
integrating various **payment** services and implementing **SEO** requirements for **multi-market webshops**.  

My technical skills include working with Angular framework, Node.js, Bootstrap, MongoDB, SAP...

My programming languages are **TypeScript** and **Golang**, plus rusty Java and R.     

I have experience in DevOps processes (Jenkins, AWS, GitHub actions) and Agile development (Jira).

I have average communication and presentation skills, a good attitude towards **teamwork**, and experience **onboarding** Junior developers.     
I am also interested in **UX** design, **DX** and femtech.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a decentralised network system for the Travel Industry for [Camino](https://camino.network/)  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang
